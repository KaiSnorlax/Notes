The class of regular languages is closed under the contatenation operation.

if $A_{1} and A_{2}$ are regular languages then so is $A_{1} \circ A_{2}$.



Let the alphabet Σ be the standard 26 letters {a, b, . . . , z}. If $A$ = {good, bad}
and $B$ = {boy, girl}, then

$A \cup B = \{good, bad, boy, girl\}$

$A \circ B = \{goodboy, goodgirl, badboy, badgirl\}$
$A^{*} = \{ε, good, bad, goodgood, goodbad, badgood, badbad, goodgoodgood, goodgoodbad, goodbadgood, goodbadbad, . . . \}.$
