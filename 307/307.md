Feature
Story          -> Task* (Dev)
PBI

Agile is good for checking on what is done

We define the size of tasks as a team

Its not one story per person, tasks can be subdivided to different people
* This is mainly the case when tasks involve UI. You would have someone who is great at UI work on that task.
* UI is never the main story, they are just a point of access to the functionality

Connections should go smooth like a puzzle piece. 
* Should constantly be asking what the task your working on will be connection

- SCRUM

Story -> Tasks -> Line of code


As a user I want to create a room
- create GUI for user login
	- *provide image*

MVC
- View (GUI)
- Model (data)
	- behavior
	- functionality
	- services
	- Blackboard
		- Repository (place to put and retrieve data)
- Controller ()
	- Listeners

Stories

As a team member, I want to create a new session so participants can join
- Design "Create Session" GUI
	- Inputs: Session name, max players
- Implement session creation logic and store session in memory
- Generate unique session ID
- Display active session info on screen

As a participant, I want to join a session so I can estimate stories with the team
- Design "Join Session" GUI
	- Input: Session ID
- Implement participant registration logic
- Show list of current participants in session view

As a facilitator, I want to add stories to estimate so the team can vote on them
- Create form to input story title and description
- Add stories to an internal list (per session)
- Display list of stories in a table or card list view

As a team member, I want to see the card visually, so I can choose one
- Design and draw Planning Poker cards in the UI
- Add hover and click visual feedback
	- e.g. highlight on selection
- Adjust layout responsively if the window resizes

As a team member, I want to submit my vote for the current story
- Implement vote selection logic
	- Handle when a card is clicked
- Link vote to the current participant
- Allow vote change but prevent multiple votes
- Store vote in session memory

As a facilitator, I want to reveal the votes after everyone has submitted theirs
- Implement "Reveal Votes" button
- Display votes in list
	- keep it anonymous
- Show average or consensus result

As a user, I want to see who has voted
- Add status indicator next to each participant
	- e.g. "voted" vs. "waiting"
- Update UI in real-time as votes are submitted
- Highlight result when all votes are completed

As a team, we want to reset so that the team can estimate a new story
- Add "Next Story" button
- Clear vote states and load next story
- Enable re-voting if needed

As a user, I want to export the voting results to a text or CSV file
- Implement result export logic
- Let user choose file location
	- Swing JFileChooser
- Save story title, votes, average



#### Design / Modeling

Structural models of software display the organization of a system in terms of
- The parts (items, elements, component) that make up that system
	- Their relationships

UML Diagrams
-> Class diagram
	- Show the classes in a system
		- modifiers
		- Attributes
		- methods
	- Relationships between the classes
		- Association /  Dependency
		- Aggregation / Composition
		- Generalization / Specialization / Realization
